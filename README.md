# Taking

A syntactical sugar for Pattern Matching like Elixir.

This is a very rudimentary implementation for testing, and may be expanded upon later as new ideas come up.

## Usage

Elixir allows us to pattern match on methods, this allows us to do it using Ruby's one-liner methods and argument forwarding (`...`):

```ruby
def handle_responses(...) = case Taking.from(...)
  in 1, 2, 3  then :numbers
  in 'a', 'b' then :strings
  in :a, :b   then :symbols
  else             false
end

handle_responses(1,2,3)
# => :numbers
handle_responses('a', 'b')
# => :strings
handle_responses(:a, :b)
# => :symbols
handle_responses(:nope?)
# => false

def handle_kw_responses(...) = case Taking.from_kw(...)
  in x: 0, y: 0    then :origin
  in x: 0, y: 10.. then :north
  else             false
end

handle_responses(x: 0, y: 0)
# => :origin
handle_responses(x: 0, y: 15)
# => :north
handle_responses(x: 10, y: 15)
# => :false
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'taking'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install taking

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
