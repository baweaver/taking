# Taking

A syntactical sugar for Pattern Matching like Elixir.

This is a very rudimentary implementation for testing, and may be expanded upon later as new ideas come up.

## Usage

Elixir allows us to pattern match on methods, this allows us to do it using Ruby's one-liner methods and argument forwarding (`...`):

```ruby
Point = Struct.new(:x, :y)

def handle_responses(...) = case Taking.from(...)
  in Point[x, 10 => y]
    Point[x, y + 1]
  in 1, 2, 3
    :numbers
  in 'a', 'b'
    :strings
  in :a, :b
    :symbols
  in x: 0, y: 0
    :origin
  in x: 0, y: (10..)
    :north
  else
    false
end

# Array-like

handle_responses(1,2,3)
# => :numbers
handle_responses('a', 'b')
# => :strings
handle_responses(:a, :b)
# => :symbols
handle_responses(:nope?)
# => false

# Hash-like

handle_responses(x: 0, y: 0)
# => :origin
handle_responses(x: 0, y: 15)
# => :north
handle_responses(x: 10, y: 15)
# => :false

# Deconstructable Object

handle_responses(Point[1, 10])
# => Point[1, 11]
```

## Installation
